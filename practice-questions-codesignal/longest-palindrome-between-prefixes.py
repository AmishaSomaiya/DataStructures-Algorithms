'''
given a string s. Apply this algo to this string:
Take all prefixes of the string, choose the longest palindrome between them
If this chosen prefix contains atleast 2 characters, cut this prefix from s and go back to the first step with the updated string. 
Otherwise, end the algorithm with the current string s as a result. 
Implement this algorithm and return its result when applies to string s.
